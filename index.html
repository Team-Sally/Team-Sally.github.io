    <p id="gurd"> Hello There .. <br> In a nutshell, this is a simple chat app .. no big features. That means only letters can be sent from this. Images and emojis cannot be sent through this .. We do not expect to post them ..<br>
      
     The appearance of this app can be said to be a very smooth app. Once you go to the link, you can see the register form .. Fill it all. Give the picture too. Then click on the Continue to Chat button. Then the top of your profile will show the people you can chat with in the app. You can log out. But you can not change the profile picture, name, password.<br>
      
      As for the security of this app, it was decided to leave it in a private account.
The account is determined under a high security password. The password of your account is saved in a secret way in the database. That's it <br><br>
